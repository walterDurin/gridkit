# Distributed resource coordinator #


Coherence ToolBox contains several utility projects for Oracle Coherence IMDG.

# Data Loss Listener #

[Data Loss Listener](DataLossListener.md) enables lost partitions detection in hardware fault or network split scenarios. Supports application-provided callback for emergency shutdown or recovery.

# Cluster Statistics Tool #

[Statistics Tool](ClusterStats.md) provides cache-based, cluster-wide statistics, such as cache access latencies or other application-specific metrics.

# Distributed Resource Coordinator #

[Resource Coordinator](DistributedResourceCoordinator.md) is a reliable resource sharing, balancing and re-balancing (HA) library. May be used to share database connections, Extend connections, JMX topics or queues, and any other resources among Coherence cluster nodes.

# Test Utils #

[Test Utils](TestUtils.md) may be efficiently used for unit- and integration-testing of tools and projects. Run Coherence cluster, or even two, in a single JVM to perform JUnit tests without any external infrastructure.>>>>>>> .[r928](https://code.google.com/p/gridkit/source/detail?r=928)
